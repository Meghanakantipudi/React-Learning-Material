The React.js framework is an open-source Javascript framework and library developed by Facebook.
It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla Javascript.

why to use React?

1. Component - Based Architecture
2. Virtual DOM
3. Decalrative syntax
4. Reusability
5. Large Ecosystem
6. String Community Support
7. Backed by Facebook


In software development, "build tools" are programs or frameworks that automate the creation of executable applications from source code. These tools streamline 
the compilation, linking, packaging, and deployment processes, making it easier and faster to manage and build projects, especially as they grow in size and 
complexity. 


For React development, several popular build tools are available to help bundle, optimize, and manage dependencies effectively. Each has unique features, and the choice depends on project complexity, team preferences, and build requirements. Here’s a comparison of the main build tools used with React:

For React development, several popular build tools are available to help bundle, optimize, and manage dependencies effectively. Each has unique features, and the choice depends on project complexity, team preferences, and build requirements. Here’s a comparison of the main build tools used with React:

### 1. **Webpack**
   - **Overview**: A powerful and configurable module bundler widely used in React applications.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Highly customizable; allows fine-grained control over bundling, loaders, and plugins.
     - Optimizes JavaScript, CSS, and other assets for production.
     - Strong community support and extensive plugins (e.g., for code splitting, hot module replacement).
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for medium-to-large projects where customization and optimization are necessary.
   - **Setup Complexity**: Moderate to high; requires configuration through a `webpack.config.js` file, which can be complex for beginners.

### 2. **Parcel**
   - **Overview**: A zero-config bundler that focuses on simplicity and speed.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Zero configuration by default, but still allows customization if needed.
     - Fast build times due to multi-core compilation and caching.
     - Supports code splitting, hot module replacement, and multiple asset types without additional plugins.
   - **Use Case**: Great for small-to-medium projects or quick prototyping where fast setup and development speed are prioritized.
   - **Setup Complexity**: Low; works with minimal configuration out of the box.

### 3. **Vite**
   - **Overview**: A fast, modern build tool created by the Vue.js team but supports React and other frameworks.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Lightning-fast development server due to ES module imports and optimized builds.
     - Minimal configuration, with plugins for extended functionality (compatible with Rollup plugins).
     - Fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and optimized for development.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for modern frontend projects that need fast builds and server response.
   - **Setup Complexity**: Low to moderate; simpler than Webpack but allows for significant customization.

### 4. **Create React App (CRA)**
   - **Overview**: Facebook’s boilerplate for React apps, based on Webpack but pre-configured for easy setup.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Requires almost no configuration to get started.
     - Integrates well with the React ecosystem, including testing and production optimization.
     - Ideal for beginners; CRA hides Webpack complexity.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for beginners, small to medium projects, or those who prefer opinionated setups.
   - **Setup Complexity**: Low; can be extended with `eject` but that exposes complex configuration.

### 5. **esbuild**
   - **Overview**: An extremely fast JavaScript bundler and minifier, written in Go.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Very fast bundling and minification, outperforming many traditional tools.
     - Lightweight, with minimal configuration needed.
     - Supports ES6 and modern JavaScript syntax out of the box.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for projects that prioritize speed and minimalism, especially for simpler React applications or smaller projects.
   - **Setup Complexity**: Low; typically less customizable than Webpack or Vite.

### 6. **Snowpack**
   - **Overview**: A build tool designed for a faster workflow by serving unbundled JavaScript in development.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Fast development server without bundling, relying on native ES modules.
     - Great for fast rebuilds and lower configuration overhead.
   - **Use Case**: Suited for simpler projects that rely on ES modules.
   - **Setup Complexity**: Low to moderate; works well with plugins for additional functionality.

### Summary Table

| Tool          | Strengths                                | Setup Complexity | Best for                                    |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Webpack**   | Customizable, large community, plugins  | Moderate to High | Medium-to-large, complex React projects    |
| **Parcel**    | Zero config, fast builds, simplicity    | Low              | Small-to-medium projects, quick setups     |
| **Vite**      | Fast, modern, optimized HMR             | Low to Moderate  | Modern projects needing fast builds        |
| **Create React App (CRA)** | Beginner-friendly, pre-configured | Low | Small-medium projects, quick start with React |
| **esbuild**   | Extremely fast, lightweight             | Low              | Smaller or speed-prioritized React projects |
| **Snowpack**  | Fast rebuilds, works with ES modules    | Low to Moderate  | Simpler projects, ES module-based projects |

Choosing the right tool often depends on your project’s scale and specific requirements. Webpack is highly flexible, Vite and esbuild offer speed, and CRA is beginner-friendly and straightforward for smaller projects.

Let's use vite for our project

Different functions of your project is divided into a different component inorder to maintain easily.

when we merge javscript and html code its called jsx.

jsx is not readable by browser. babel package transfers jsx to html and give it to browser

Whenever we are returining  a multiple components we should use react fragments.

We can use React.fragment() or <> </>
