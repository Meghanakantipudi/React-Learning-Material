// In the React Project imdb clone, we faced a problem called `props drilling`
// props drilling is the concept of having to pass a message from root level componenet to any of its child component which is very low level in the tree through only its middle child components.
// This will be problem in hige projects to maintain state.

// Inorder to solve this we are using hook called useContext()

// I have created a example project above called conetxt api

To Remember:

export const Context = React.createContext(''); -- create this in one jsx file and import in ur app file

import { Context } from <fileName>

Wrap the return of App component inside <Context.Provider value ={'Message I want to Pass to all my child components'}></Context.Provider>

Now, if i need that message in any of my Child Components, i need to

import { Context } from <filename>

const Message = React.useContext(Context)

and i can use it!
